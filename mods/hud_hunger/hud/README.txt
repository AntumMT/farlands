About this mod:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This mod improves the HUD of Minetest and adds (hidden by default) statbars for Hunger and Armor.
Also it provides an API to add new statbars easily, see API.txt for more informations.

Changes in builtin HUD items:
- Adds background for Health bar
- Uses better textures for Hotbar
- Uses texture for crosshair
- Positions of builtin statbars can be changed via "hud.conf" file
- Experimental "ItemWheel" that replaces the hotbar (must be enabled by adding "hud_item_wheel = true" in minetest.conf)

This mod gets provided as Modpack aswell, which includes the hunger mod (https://github.com/BlockMen/hunger)
More information concerning the hunger mechanics can be get there.

This mod supports the 3d_armor mod by stu (https://github.com/stujones11/minetest-3d_armor)
